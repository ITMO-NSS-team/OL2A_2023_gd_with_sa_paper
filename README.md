# OL2A_2023_generative_design_with_sa_paper
Repository for "Interpretable Structural Analysis for Evolutionary Generative Design of Coastal Breakwaters" paper submitted to OL2A conference

In the paper, the sensitivity-based approach implemented in [GEFEST](https://github.com/aimclub/GEFEST) framework was applied to improve optimization process of structures of breakwaters.

 - *exp_archives* folder contains archives of experiment results such [quality metric, structures, time] history
 - *exp_results.ipynb*  jupyter-notebook consists analysis and visualization code
 - *swan_config* file contains the SWAN configuration applied during experiments

 It requires installiing *requirements.txt* to launch sensitivity-based approach to optimize a structure via *run_sensopt.py*
